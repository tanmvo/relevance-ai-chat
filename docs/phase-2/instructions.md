# Instructions — Polls Feature (Phase 2)

## Before Starting a Task

1. **Create a plan.** Read the relevant docs (`PRD.md`, `tasks.md`, `AGENTS.md`) and outline the implementation steps, files to create/modify, and any dependencies.
2. **Provide a confidence score.** Rate your confidence (1–10) for the tasks involved, noting any risks or unknowns.
3. **Once completed, mark tasks off in `tasks.md`.** Update checkboxes from `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for every completed item.
4. **Add phase notes.** After completing a step, write a phase completion note in `docs/phase-2/phases/` following the naming convention `step-N.md` (e.g., `step-1.md`).
